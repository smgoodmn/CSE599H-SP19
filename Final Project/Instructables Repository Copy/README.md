# Kitchen Sound Identifier
Materials for Instructable detailing the creation of a Kitchen Sound Classification System.

For our final project in an interactive systems course this spring, we created a real-time system for identifying and visualizing common sounds in the kitchen using Support-Vector Machine classification. The system is comprised of a laptop for audio sampling/classification, and an Arduino/dot matrix display for visualization.
